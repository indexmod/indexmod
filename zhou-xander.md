The designer has successfully established a cult fan base both domestically and internationally, and is at the forefront of a new wave of young Chinese designers crafting a new menswear aesthetic. In addition to his own label, the eponymous designer is also menswear director at The New York Times’ T Magazine China Edition. Zhou studied industrial design in China before studying fashion design in the Netherlands. He established his label in 2007, and although Beijing-based, he presents seasonal collections during London Fashion Week Men’s — making him the first Chinese designer to do so. Xander Zhou is currently sold in about 20 multi-brand stores across East Asia, Western Europe, North America, and the Middle East. Longstanding stockists include 10 Corso Como, Dong Liang and Shine in China, GR8 in Japan, Opening Ceremony in Japan and the US, Boon the Shop and Addicted in Korea, and Machine-A in the UK.

In addition to his design work, Zhou has also consulted for brands, helping to foster relationships within the fashion industry. “I introduce Chinese commercial brands to stylists, photographers, model agencies, and other partners I’ve met through my work abroad, helping them establish strong working relationships,” he shared with BoF. “These collaborations have been well-received in the advertising and fashion industries.” The designer attributes his success to his authenticity: “I have always tried to stay true to my vision — in my designs, in my styling, and also in my personal style. By doing so, I have attracted a sophisticated, luxury-oriented customer base” <span id="a2">[\[2\]](#f2)</span>.
