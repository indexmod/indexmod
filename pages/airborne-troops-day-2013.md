The video "День ВДВ" (Day of the Airborne Troops), created by Anna Schiller in 2013, captures a unique performance during the Airborne Troops Day celebrations in St. Petersburg. This 2-minute and 53-second piece embodies a juxtaposition of militaristic themes against a backdrop of chaotic revelry, showcasing the contrast between the artist's graceful demeanor and the drunken revelers in striped shirts and shorts who populate Palace Square.

## Concept and Themes

**Militaristic Arbitrariness**: Schiller's work explores themes of militarism and cultural values, reflecting on how public spaces like Palace Square can symbolize both national pride and chaotic celebration. The video contrasts the artist's poised movements with the disorderly actions of those around her, creating a commentary on societal norms and expectations during such events.

**Cultural Significance of Palace Square**: The setting is historically significant, known for its architectural beauty and as a site of pivotal events in Russian history, including political protests and celebrations. The square features notable structures such as the Winter Palace and the Alexander Column, which add layers of meaning to Schiller's performance. The juxtaposition of her artful dance against the backdrop of military celebration raises questions about cultural identity amidst political sentiment[2][4][6].

## Conclusion

The ending of the video remains open-ended, with Schiller dancing into the night, symbolizing a willingness to embrace uncertainty and follow new paths. This act of leaving the conclusion ambiguous invites viewers to reflect on their interpretations of freedom, chaos, and cultural expression within a militaristic context[5].

(Rus. День ВДВ, created in 2013, St. Petersburg) is a video 2 min. 53 sec. of the performance by Anna Schiller in a so-called genre of the video of random events that occurred with Anna Schiller during a holiday of Airborne troops day in the summer of 2013 in St. Petersburg. Putting yourself in the space of militarist arbitrariness, Schiller embodies the exact opposite of what is unfolding before the eyes of the viewer: on the background of falling into the fountain drunken bodies in striped T-shirts, shorts and invitations to the toilet are the antitheses of aloofness, inaccessibility, ease heroine. Everything happens at the Palace Square and its surroundings, which are a symbol of the cultural capital, which can also be interpreted ambiguously: either space in the metaphor of the modern political process, with its militaristic sentiments and care of cultural values, whether the approach contrary to the last even through placing a certain ideal image in cultureless nightmarish reality. Schiller leaves the end open, dancing, going into the night, it becomes a follower, which is now ready to follow her.
