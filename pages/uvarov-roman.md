## Bio

After leaving school, Roman moved to Krasnodar and entered the Faculty of Advertising and PR at KubSU. In 2018, the designer received a diploma in the specialty. After high school, Roman worked as a photographer with the Krasnodar designer Olga Sadova, and also helped with sewing the collection and advertising campaigns.

## Direct speech

“My task is not just to dress people - they can do it themselves by looking at a couple of stores. I help them experiment with their life. My brand aims to direct humanity in a different, better direction.”

“A million worries and worries, you are alone with yourself and the only one in your hands when there are hundreds of people on the crew behind the scenes and around you”. <span id="a5">[\[5\]](#f5)</span>
