Rustam Solntsev, born Rustam Kalganov on December 29, 1976, in Slavyansk-on-Kuban, Russia, is a controversial figure best known for his multiple appearances on the reality TV show "Dom-2"[1][2].

## Early Life and Career

Rustam grew up in a family of Soviet intelligentsia, with his mother Valentina being well-educated and his father Pyotr working as a party official[2].

After leaving the show, Solntsev opened a beauty salon and continued to appear on television, participating in programs such as "Eat and Lose Weight!" and "Superintuition"[2]. He also created a YouTube channel where he shares vlogs, performs songs, and comments on current events[2].

## Controversies
