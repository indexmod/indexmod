Otokomae is an **art-space** located in Moscow, Russia, situated at Neglinnaya 10 (postal code 107031). It is a unique venue that describes itself as a "space that erases stereotypes"[6].

## Key Features
- Located in central Moscow
- Categorized as an **arts and entertainment** venue
- Has an active social media presence with over 1,700 posts on Instagram[2][4]
- Contact number: +7 495 646-56-21

## Additional Context
While the search results also reference an art boutique hotel with the same name, the art-space appears to be a distinct cultural venue that hosts various exhibitions and events. For instance, one search result mentions an exhibition called "X_VISION" inspired by Ploom X, which was designed to engage visitors' five senses[8].

The venue seems to be an innovative space that aims to challenge traditional artistic boundaries, as suggested by their self-description of "erasing stereotypes"[6]. It appears to be an active cultural platform in Moscow's art scene.
