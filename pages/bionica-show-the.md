The Bionica Show is a luxurious Performance & Dance Theatre based in Moscow, Russia. Founded in the summer of 2006, the show incorporates elements of natural philosophy and Buddhism into its performances[1]. The Bionica Show is known for its elaborate and visually stunning productions, including performances such as the "Russian Dolls" dance, which is set to Igor Stravinsky's "The Firebird" ballet music[7][8].

As of January 2025, the Bionica Show continues to be active, with an online presence on various social media platforms. They have a Facebook page with over 1,000 likes[5] and an Instagram account with 138 followers and 71 posts as of the last available data[6].

The show's performances blend traditional Russian cultural elements with modern dance and theatrical techniques, creating a unique and captivating experience for audiences. Their "Russian Dolls" performance, for example, likely draws inspiration from the iconic matryoshka dolls while incorporating contemporary dance movements and music.
