About (clothing) Ut.lt is no longer an active brand. The company Utenos Trikotažas, which previously owned the "About" trademark, has settled a dispute with the German company About You GmbH in December 2024[2]. As part of this settlement:

1. Utenos Trikotažas' subsidiary Aboutwear received a compensation of €2 million from About You GmbH.
2. Aboutwear transferred its controlled trademarks, including "ABOUT BALTIC UNDERWEAR" and "ABOUT THE SENSOLOGY OF WEAR," to About You GmbH.
3. Aboutwear committed to changing its name to no longer use the "About" mark.

This settlement ended a four-year dispute over the trademark. The compensation received will be used to implement Utenos Trikotažas' restructuring plan, which was approved in October 2024[2].

Utenos Trikotažas is now focusing on its core business as one of the largest knitwear manufacturers in Central and Eastern Europe, specializing in on-demand ready-to-wear production and jersey fabric development for international brands[2].
