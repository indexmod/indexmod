Partizaning is not an international group, but a Russian urban art and activism project focused on grassroots urban improvement. It was a group of artists, urbanists, and theorists who emerged in the early 2010s in Russia[1][2].

**Key Characteristics**
- Founded by Igor Ponosov (born 1980), a Russian artist and urban researcher[2]
- Operated at the intersection of art, urbanism, and sociology[1]
- Engaged in **unauthorized urban interventions** such as:
  - Creating pedestrian crossings
  - Installing additional parking spaces
  - Setting up road signs and benches in areas residents needed them
  - Placing mailboxes in residential Moscow districts to learn about community needs[1]

**Artistic and Social Context**
The project emerged during a period of new artistic movements in Russia following the USSR's collapse, characterized by politically and socially engaged street actions. Partizaning represented a form of **bottom-up urban planning** that challenged traditional city management approaches[2].

A notable perspective from Ksenia Mokrushina, an urban planning expert, describes Partizaning as a crucial movement that awakens **civic consciousness** and creates a demand for urban changes "from the bottom up"[3].
