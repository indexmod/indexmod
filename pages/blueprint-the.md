The Blueprint is a leading Russian lifestyle publication and independent online media outlet focusing on fashion, beauty, and contemporary culture[3]. It has established itself as a prominent new-age media source in Russia over the past decade[3].

Alexander Perepelkin, the editorial director of The Blueprint, describes it as "Russia's leading lifestyle publication"[1]. The site has gained significance in the Russian media landscape, particularly after the departure of international publishers like Cond√© Nast from the Russian market[1].

The Blueprint continues to operate in Russia, providing coverage on fashion, luxury goods, and lifestyle topics. It has become an important source of information for the Russian audience, especially in the context of international sanctions and the rebranding of foreign products in the country[1].
