Santa Fe hosts two distinct fashion weeks: SWAIA Native Fashion Week and Santa Fe Fashion Week.

**SWAIA Native Fashion Week** is a specialized event focusing on Indigenous designers. In 2024, it will take place from May 2-5, showcasing Native American and Indigenous Canadian designers[1][2][4]. The event aims to establish Santa Fe as the Indigenous fashion capital of North America[3].

**Upcoming 2025 Event**
SWAIA Native Fashion Week is scheduled for May 7-11, 2025. The event will feature:
- Multiple runway shows
- Pop-up shops
- Activation spaces
- Fashion panels

**Santa Fe Fashion Week** is a broader fashion event that celebrates fashion industry professionals and supports social responsibility[5][6]. However, the specific details about Santa Fe Fashion Week are less comprehensive in the provided search results.

The key distinction is that SWAIA Native Fashion Week specifically highlights Indigenous designers and their creative expressions, while Santa Fe Fashion Week appears to be a more general fashion showcase.
