AES+F is a collective of four Russian artists: Tatiana Arzamasova (born 1955), Lev Evzovich (born 1958), Evgeny Svyatsky (born 1957), and Vladimir Fridkes (born 1956)[1][2]. The group was initially formed as AES Group in 1987 by Arzamasova, Evzovich, and Svyatsky, with Fridkes joining in 1995 to complete the current formation[2].

Working across various media, including photography, video, installation, animation, painting, drawing, and sculpture, AES+F is known for creating grand visual narratives that explore contemporary global values, vices, and conflicts[2]. Their work often combines elements from art history, pop culture, and current events to create complex, multi-layered spectacles[4].

## Notable Works and Achievements

- **Islamic Project** (1996-2003): A provocative series imagining Western culture under Islamic influence[2].
- **Last Riot** (2005-2007): A computer-generated animation presenting a dystopian scene[3].
- **Allegoria Sacra**: This work won several prestigious awards, including the Kandinsky Prize (2012) and the Pino Pascali Prize (2015)[2].
- **Turandot**: A recent operatic production exploring themes of female authoritarianism and the #MeToo movement[4].

AES+F has exhibited at numerous international festivals and biennales, including Venice, Lyon, Sydney, and Moscow[2]. Their works are featured in major collections worldwide, such as the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris and the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow[2].

The collective describes their practice as a form of "social psychoanalysis or collective catharsis," addressing collective fears, anxieties, and desires through their art[4]. Their unique approach and visually striking works have established AES+F as one of the most successful and commercially viable art groups in Russia[5].
