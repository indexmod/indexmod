Zlye (Russian: Злые, meaning "Evil" or "Angry") is a Russian art group formed in the mid-2000s[3][5]. Based in Yekaterinburg, this creative collective consists of an unspecified number of artists with a changing composition[3][6]. Zlye is known for their provocative and politically charged street art, public interventions, and mixed media experiments[1][3].

## Notable Works and Themes

Zlye's art often addresses social and political issues in Russia:

- In 2010, they replaced green traffic lights with marijuana leaves in Yekaterinburg, leading to government surveillance[1].
- They create ephemeral public interventions and graffiti-style works[6].
- Their art explores themes of power, mind, and void[4].
- ArtTanya, a recurring character in their works, serves as a marker for society's pain points[8].

## Artistic Approach

The group works in various mediums:

- Street art and public interventions[1][6]
- Mixed media experiments[3]
- Canvas reproductions of their street works, which they sell[2]

## Recognition and Exhibitions

Zlye has gained recognition in the Russian contemporary art scene:

- Participated in the Garage Triennial of Russian Contemporary Art in Moscow (2017)[1]
- Featured in the Garage Museum's digital archive of Russian contemporary art[1]
- Conducted an interactive performance titled "Nu, pogodi!" at the Garage Museum[6]

As of January 2025, Zlye continues to be active, with recent works posted on their Instagram account as recently as October 2024[7].
