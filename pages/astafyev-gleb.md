Gleb Astafyev is a notable figure in contemporary Russian art and activism, particularly known for his bold actions in support of free expression and against political repression. Born in 2000, he gained attention at the age of 16 when he staged a solitary picket in Kurgan, Russia, to support the dissident artist Pyotr Pavlensky, who was facing legal issues for his provocative performances. Astafyev's demonstration involved sewing his mouth shut and holding a placard, which led to his arrest and subsequent confinement in a psychiatric hospital for 15 days[1][2].

Astafyev's act was not only a protest but also a commentary on the state of political dissent in Russia. During his time in the psychiatric facility, he described harrowing conditions, including forced medication that he believed rendered patients unresponsive. His experience highlighted the troubling resurgence of punitive psychiatry in Russia, reminiscent of Soviet-era practices used to silence dissenters[2]. Following his release, Astafyev continued to express his views on the importance of artistic freedom and the need for societal change.

In addition to his activism, Astafyev has been portrayed as an insightful and articulate individual who is deeply concerned about social issues. Documentaries have been made about him, showcasing his journey and perspectives as a young artist navigating a complex political landscape[1]. His story resonates with many as it reflects the challenges faced by youth in oppressive regimes and their desire for change through artistic expression.
