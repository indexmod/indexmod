Вятский модник, or "Vyatsky Modnik," translates to "Vyatka Fashionista" in English. This term refers to Viktor Kazakovtsev, a 72-year-old pensioner from Kirov (historically known as Vyatka), who has gained local and even international fame for his vibrant and eclectic fashion sense. Kazakovtsev is recognized for wearing colorful outfits, often created from second-hand clothing that he modifies himself. His unique style has made him a local celebrity, leading to features on Russian television and even coverage in international media, including a segment aired in China[1][3][5].

The phrase "Вятский модник" encapsulates not just his fashion choices but also his role as a cultural icon within his community, symbolizing creativity and individuality against a backdrop of more conventional attire[1].
