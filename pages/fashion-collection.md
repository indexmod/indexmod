Fashion Collection is the first Russian fashion magazine, established in 2003 by Marina Demchenko in Moscow[1]. Published by Global Media International, it has become a prominent voice in the Russian fashion industry over the past two decades[1].

The magazine features:

- Interviews with famous personalities
- Advice from renowned stylists and fashion experts
- Current news in fashion and art
- Fashion photoshoots

Fashion Collection has expanded its reach significantly since its inception:

- Network of branches in 15 regions across Russia
- International presence in Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan
- Distribution in France and Monaco since winter 2014-2015

With a circulation of 111,000 copies, Fashion Collection has garnered recognition in the industry:

- Received the Fashion TV award for "First Russian Fashion Magazine" in 2011
- Marina Demchenko, the editor-in-chief, was named "Most Stylish Editor-in-Chief" by Fashion TV in 2014[1]

The magazine maintains a consistent editorial policy across all regional editions, including the cover, while local offices supplement content relevant to each city[1]. This approach allows Fashion Collection to cater to both national and local fashion interests, solidifying its position as a leading fashion publication in Russia and neighboring countries.
