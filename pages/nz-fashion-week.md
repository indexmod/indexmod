New Zealand Fashion Week (NZFW) is an annual fashion event held in Auckland, New Zealand that showcases local and international designers[2][3][4]. Founded in 2001 by Dame Pieter Stewart, the event has become a significant platform for the fashion industry[4].

## Key Details

- **Dates**: Traditionally held in late August/early September
- **Location**: Auckland, New Zealand
- **Venue**: Previously Viaduct Events Centre, now moving to Shed 10 at Queens Wharf in 2025[1][7][8]
- **Attendees**: Over 25,000 fashion-focused delegates[4]

## Recent History

The event experienced significant disruption during the COVID-19 pandemic, with fashion weeks cancelled in 2020, 2021, and 2022[2]. In 2023, NZFW returned with a focus on **Te Ao Māori** (Māori worldview) and **sustainability**[4].

## Upcoming Event

In 2025, NZFW will transition to a **biennial format**, scheduled from August 25-30, taking place at Shed 10 on Queens Wharf in Tāmaki Makaurau (Auckland)[7][8]. This marks a new chapter for the event, which has traditionally been an annual showcase of fashion, art, and culture[1][3][4].
