## From Tatyana Lvovna Shchepkina-Kupernik

“I remember her cozy figure in the hood and cap, as she came to me for the night, when I was about to fall asleep, and put a piece of kurnik or something else on the bedside table, speaking with her sweet breath,“ What if the baby is hungry? ” .., ”recalled Tatyana Lvovna Shchepkina-Kupernik about Yevgeny Yakovlevna, the mother of the writer.”


## From Yalta

The memorial item was transferred to the Melikhov Museum of Yalta in 1957, and before that more than half a century was carefully kept by Maria Pavlovna.
