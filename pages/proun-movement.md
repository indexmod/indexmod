## 1920s El Lissitzky Proun

Proun was an innovative artistic movement developed by El Lissitzky in the early 1920s. The term "Proun" is an acronym for "project for the affirmation of the new" in Russian[1][5]. Lissitzky created Proun as a new type of artwork that combined elements of Suprematism, Constructivism, Futurism, and Cubism[2].

Proun artworks were characterized by:

1. Geometric abstraction
2. Dynamic compositions
3. Architectural elements
4. Multi-dimensional spatial constructions

Lissitzky described Proun as a "station on the path to the construction of the new form"[3]. It aimed to bridge the gap between painting and architecture, creating a new visual language for a post-revolutionary world[1]. Proun works often featured floating geometric shapes, precise lines, and a sense of movement within a limitless space[3].

The Proun movement emerged during a time of significant social and political change in Russia, just a few years after the 1917 revolution[1]. Lissitzky and his contemporaries sought to create art that reflected and contributed to the transformation of society[4].

Proun had a lasting impact on abstract art and design, influencing various fields including architecture, graphic design, and typography. It represented a significant step in the development of non-objective art and the integration of art with technology and everyday life[3].
