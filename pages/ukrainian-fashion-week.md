Ukrainian Fashion Week (UFW) has made a significant return to Kyiv, marking a pivotal moment for the country's fashion industry after a two-year hiatus due to the ongoing conflict. The event took place from September 1 to 4, 2024, showcasing the Spring/Summer 2025 collections of over 40 designers, including both established names and emerging talents[2][3].

### Key Highlights of Ukrainian Fashion Week 2024

- **Symbol of Resilience**: The event is seen as a powerful statement of defiance and cultural pride amid the war. Designers expressed their commitment to creativity despite the challenges posed by missile attacks and air raid sirens[2][3].

- **Cultural Connection**: Collections presented were deeply rooted in Ukrainian culture, with some designers opting for performances that reimagined traditional folk tales. For instance, Ivan Frolov staged a performance based on the folk tale "Ivasyk-Telesyk," emphasizing the importance of folklore in contemporary Ukrainian identity[2].

- **Support and Solidarity**: The event received support from notable figures, including First Lady Olena Zelenska, and aimed to amplify Ukraine's voice on a global stage. Iryna Danylevska, UFW's CEO, highlighted that the resilience shown by Ukrainian designers is a testament to their unbreakable spirit[3][2].

### Upcoming Events

Following the September event, Ukrainian Fashion Week is scheduled to take place again from February 14 to 17, 2025. This upcoming season will continue to celebrate Ukraine's rich cultural heritage and creative talent in the face of adversity[4][5].

The return of UFW not only revitalizes the local fashion scene but also serves as a beacon of hope and resilience for Ukrainians during these challenging times.

## Liana Satenstein

"Ukraine is stricken by war, corruption, and a financial crisis. At its Fashion Weeks, like Mercedes-Benz Kiev Fashion Days and this past Ukrainian Fashion Week, the dichotomy between the haves and have-nots is visible and sharp: Wealthy consumers occupy the front rows; young creatives typically struggle financially, but they do compelling work. This economic disparity may be why the Vetements look is so strong here. The Paris brand’s signature hoodie is about three times the average monthly salary of around $300 in Kiev, but the city’s young people can head to a secondhand bazaar and re-create the pricey image on the cheap - from Liana Satenstein's report Vogue.com.

"Since the rise of Vetements, post-Soviet fashion across Eastern Europe has been problematically glamourised with the term ‘soviet fashion’ bandied around as if it were a trend. But the reality is that each of the post-soviet countries with a growing fashion industry have positionings that are very different. They can’t be lumped together purely by being post-Soviet countries. Ukraine’s fashion offering for example, would be better compared to London or Copenhagen, if you were going to compare it at all." - from Grace Banks's UFW 2019 venue report.
