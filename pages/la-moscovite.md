La Moscovite (рус. Москвичка) is a Russian brand founded by Ariadna Cherkasova, specializing in silk shawls and accessories inspired by traditional Russian folk culture[2][4]. The brand creates collections that feature authentic folk ornaments, ancient church murals, and elegant miniature paintings from manuscripts, all translated onto premium silk and wool[2].

## Brand Identity

- **Inspiration**: Rooted in Russian folk art, particularly from the Russian North[4]
- **Materials**: Uses high-quality Italian silk, preferring twill for its noble matte finish and durability[4]
- **Production**: Designs are hand-drawn and directly printed on silk in Russia[4]

## Product Range

- Silk shawls with designs inspired by traditional Russian motifs
- Recently launched a collection of neck scarves featuring ancient Russian letters in animal style from the 12th-13th centuries[4]

## Brand Philosophy

La Moscovite aims to preserve and share the unique beauty of folk ornamental arts with the world[2]. The brand positions itself as an antidote to kitsch and tasteless decorative interpretations often associated with Russian style in fashion[4].

## Target Market

The brand's products are primarily purchased by foreigners and some Muscovites, appealing to those who appreciate the blend of traditional art with contemporary fashion[4].

## Future Plans

As of late 2018, La Moscovite was planning to open a showroom in central Moscow, designed as a cozy space with a village style to showcase their products in their natural environment[4].
