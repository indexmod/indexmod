## Historical Origins

The first NYFW, originally called "Press Week", was created during World War II to showcase American fashion designers and draw attention away from French fashion when international travel was restricted[2]. Initially, it helped American designers gain recognition in fashion magazines like Vogue, which previously focused predominantly on French designs.

- The event generates around $400 million in economic activity

## Recent Trends

Designers have been experimenting with innovative formats, such as:
- "See now, buy now" models allowing immediate purchase of runway items
- Virtual and online fashion shows
- Collaborative presentations to reduce costs[2][3]
