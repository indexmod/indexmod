Rio Fashion Week (RFW) is a biannual fashion event held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil[1][2]. The event aims to showcase Brazilian and Latin American fashion to a global audience[1].

## Key Details

- **Frequency**: Held twice a year
- **Location**: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
- **Organizer**: FFW (Fashion For World)[1][2]

## Historical Context

In 2015, Fashion Rio underwent a significant transformation. The Federation of Industries of the State of Rio de Janeiro (Firjan) created the Fashion Forum to rethink the event's format[1]. This initiative brought together local business leaders and fashion designers, including Oskar Metsavaht of Osklen, to strategize about the future of Rio's fashion market[1].

## Notable Characteristics

The fashion week is known for its unique style, reflecting the vibrant and relaxed atmosphere of Rio de Janeiro[7]. Some brands participating in Fashion Rio may also showcase their collections at SÃ£o Paulo Fashion Week to maintain their commercial and marketing strategies[1].

While the event has evolved over time, it continues to be an important platform for Brazilian and Latin American fashion designers to present their collections and gain international recognition.
