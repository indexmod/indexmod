## Random quote

“But the most talented designer of all is the designer Ruslan Bezus,” says Marina Riemer, “if he were as active now as at the beginning of his career, he would have worked in Jil Sander, no less.” Ruslan - his somewhat forgotten Bezous brand was once demonstrated at Cycles & Seasons Fashion Week, confirms: “Yes, I do everything myself: I draw, cut, put on patterns” <span id="a2">[\[2\]](#f2)</span>.
