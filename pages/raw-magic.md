Raw Magic is a significant contemporary art project that emerged in April 2016 at Galerie Iragui in Moscow. This exhibition was curated by Alexander Zhuravlev and showcased the work of a collective of young, independent artists, including Alina Glazoun, Mitya Zilberstein, Dima Kavko, Petr Kirusha, Sergei Poteryaev, Sergei Rozhin, Alexei Rumin, Matvey Segal, and Protey Temen.

## Concept and Themes

The exhibition aimed to highlight the raw and unfiltered expressions of these emerging artists, many of whom were exhibiting in a gallery setting for the first time. The works presented were characterized by their surrealistic aesthetics and a deep engagement with themes of reality and perception in contemporary Russian society. Zhuravlev emphasized the importance of addressing **social and artistic differences** through surrealism, which allows viewers to accept multiple realities simultaneously[1].

### Featured Artists and Their Works

- **Dima Kavko**: Known for his sculptures made from everyday materials, which reflect a surrealistic style with a post-internet influence.
- **Protey Temen**: His large black-and-white drawing titled "Cosmopolitan" served as a centerpiece of the exhibition, inviting viewers into a dreamlike narrative.
- **Mitya Zilberstein**: Presented Kabbalistic drawings that blend found objects with storytelling elements.
- **Matvey Segal**: His watercolors incorporated historical characters and anthropomorphisms, showcasing a blend of magic and surrealism.

The exhibition not only sought to present art but also aimed to provoke dialogue about the **chaos** of daily life in Russia and how this chaos can inspire new mental frameworks[1][5].

## Impact on the Art Scene

Raw Magic stands out in the context of Moscow's informal art scene, which often embraces experimental approaches. It represents a shift towards recognizing the potential of young artists who challenge traditional norms in art. The project aligns with broader movements within contemporary Russian art that seek to explore identity, communication, and the complexities of modern existence[1].
