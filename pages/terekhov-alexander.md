Alexander Terekhov is a prominent Russian fashion designer known for his elegant and feminine clothing. Born in 1980 in Vjazniki, Vladimir Oblast, he developed an early passion for fashion, creating outfits for dolls at a young age. He studied at the Moscow Institute of Fashion and Design, where he gained recognition for his collection "Twilight" during his studies, which earned him a second place at the All-Russian competition "Russian Silhouette" in 1999. This achievement led to an internship at Yves Saint Laurent in Paris[1][3].

In 2004, Terekhov launched his first collection featuring vibrant dresses, and by 2006, he became the only Russian designer showcasing collections at New York Fashion Week for three consecutive years. His brand, initially named simply "Terekhov," underwent a rebranding in 2010 to "Alexander Terekhov" (Atelier Moscow) after joining the Rusmoda group, aiming to reflect a concept of "Russian production at European standards"[1][2][3].

Terekhov's designs are characterized by their modern classic style and sensual femininity, with dresses being central to his collections. His work has attracted attention from both Russian and international celebrities. In addition to seasonal collections, he has created capsule collections and even ventured into children's clothing in 2014[3][4].

However, in 2020, Oksana Lavrentieva announced the closure of Alexander Terekhov (Atelier Moscow) and the associated lines. Subsequently, Terekhov launched a new brand named Sashaverse in 2021, where he has full control over the creative process[3][4].
