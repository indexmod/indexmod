Vladimir Fedorov was a significant figure in the Russian art group Inspection Medical Hermeneutics. He joined the group in 1991, replacing Yuri Leiderman, and received the status of "Fetish MG"[7]. Fedorov became a senior inspector of the group, which was established in 1987 in the Furmanny squat[5].

Inspection Medical Hermeneutics was an influential art collective that experimented with language and meaning, creating installations and performances that investigated Russian culture during the Glasnost era[1]. The group's work drew from Russian traditions, fairy tales, psychedelia, and pseudo-scientific methodology, often relating these elements to objects from Western visual culture[1].

Fedorov contributed to the group's conceptual approach, which included themes such as psychedelic realism, the exploration of time and immortality, and the interplay between life and death[3]. The group's installations often featured complex ideas, such as portrait galleries of elderly men with astronomical ages and infants with negative ages, embodying concepts of eternity and transcending traditional notions of past and future[3].

Vladimir Fedorov's involvement with Inspection Medical Hermeneutics lasted until at least 2012, as evidenced by exhibitions featuring the group's work during that time[3]. His contributions helped shape the group's unique artistic vision, which combined elements of Russian conceptualism with broader philosophical and cultural explorations.
