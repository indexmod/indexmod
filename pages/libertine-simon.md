Johnson Hartig is a prominent American fashion designer and the co-founder of the eclectic label Libertine, established in 2001. Known for his innovative approach, Hartig blends old-school aesthetics with contemporary techniques, effectively revolutionizing the ready-to-wear market for both men and women. His designs are characterized by **graphic illuminations**, **sublime screen printing**, and a unique method of **deconstructing and customizing recycled items**, which breathes new life into vintage styles[1][2].

### Early Career and Brand Development
Hartig launched Libertine from a three-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles, where he initially transformed inexpensive shirts into unique garments adorned with rococo ribbons and artistic seams. This creative flair quickly gained traction, leading to sales in high-end boutiques like Maxfield and Colette in Paris[3]. Over the years, Hartig has collaborated with notable brands and artists, including Damien Hirst, Goyard, Converse, and Target, exemplifying his philosophy that high-end luxury can coexist with mass-market appeal[2][3].

### Recognition and Influence
Libertine has garnered a significant following and critical acclaim, championed by fashion icons such as Anna Wintour and Karl Lagerfeld. The brand is celebrated for its whimsical designs that attract a diverse clientele, from East Coast socialites to West Coast creatives. Celebrities like Mick Jagger, Taylor Swift, and Gwen Stefani have been seen wearing Libertine's creations, further solidifying its status in the fashion world[1][2][3].

### Personal Life
Currently residing in Los Angeles with his rescue dogs, Hartig continues to explore new inspirations through travel and art. His work is frequently featured in prestigious publications such as *Vogue* and *The New York Times*, reflecting his ongoing influence in the fashion industry[1][3]. In 2015, he published a book titled *Libertine: The Creative Beauty, Humor, and Inspiration Behind the Cult Label*, which delves into his creative process and the ethos behind his brand[1].
