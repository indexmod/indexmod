Anton Polsky, also known by his artistic pseudonym "Make," is a Russian artist, activist, and urban researcher born in 1982 in Moscow[3][8]. He is recognized for his work in street art, urban activism, and participatory practices aimed at involving citizens in city development processes[1][4].

Polsky graduated from the Faculty of Art History at the Russian State University[1]. His artistic career began in the late 1990s when he was a member of the graffiti group "UMC" from 1997 to 2000, and later part of the "Rus Crew" from 2000 to 2004[3].

As an artist and researcher, Polsky focuses on street art and its intersection with political protest, particularly in Ukraine and Russia[6]. He is a co-founder and editor of Partizaning.org, a platform dedicated to art and urban environment[4][8]. Polsky's work often explores the tactics of urban activism and ways to engage citizens in the process of shaping their cities[1].

In addition to his artistic practice, Polsky works as a university lecturer and board game designer[4]. He has participated in various art residencies, including one in Odesa, Ukraine, in October 2019[2]. As of 2025, Polsky is based in Berlin, Germany, where he continues his work at the intersection of art, activism, and urban studies[4][5].

# On way to activism

In the late 90s, fascinated by graffiti, Anton created the first Russian magazine about street art. In recent years he worked as a designer in the online newspaper The Village. In 2010, he wrote a manifesto “Moscow 2020” on specific reforms in the capital. Then he participated in the organization of the festival community “Delay Sam”.2 Finally Moscow has acquired a printing cycling map Use / Less.3 In 2011, together with his wife Sonja and friend Igor Anton Ponosov created a website partizaning.org, dedicated underground rescheduling of the urban environment. According to the Polish, “Partizaning”—a new movement, which lies at the intersection of art and social space.
