Rafaël Rozendaal is a Dutch-Brazilian visual artist born in 1980 who currently lives and works in New York City. He is widely recognized as a pioneer of **Internet Art**[1][2][3].

## Artistic Practice

Rozendaal uses the internet as his primary canvas, creating innovative digital artworks that include websites, animations, NFTs, installations, tapestries, prints, and writings[1]. His work is characterized by a fascination with moving images and interactivity, exploring the aesthetic and conceptual possibilities of code[4].

## Notable Achievements

- **Website Art**: Rozendaal is one of the first artists to sell websites as art objects. When he sells a website, the collector owns the domain name, but the artwork remains publicly accessible. The collector's name is placed in the source code[3].

- **BYOB (Bring Your Own Beamer)**: He founded this open-source exhibition concept in 2010, allowing artists to create media art exhibitions with minimal resources. Over 150 BYOB events have been organized worldwide[3].

- **NFT Project**: In August 2021, he launched **Endless Nameless**, an NFT project with 1,000 algorithm-generated artworks on the Ethereum blockchain. The project raised approximately $430,000, with half donated to the arts nonprofit Rhizome[3].

## Exhibitions and Recognition

Rozendaal's work has been exhibited at prestigious institutions including:
- Whitney Museum of American Art
- Centre Pompidou
- Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam
- New Museum, New York
- Venice Biennale

His art has been featured in international publications like Time Magazine, Wall Street Journal, and Flash Art[1].

## Artistic Philosophy

Rozendaal believes in creating art that is universally accessible. As he states, "I always wanted to make work that could be seen by anyone, anywhere, anytime"[4]. His websites are designed to be robust, adapting fluidly across different screen resolutions and devices.
