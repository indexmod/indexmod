Elena Perminova is a Russian model and entrepreneur born on September 1, 1986, in Berdsk, Novosibirsk Oblast[2][3]. Her life story is marked by a dramatic early experience and subsequent successful modeling career.

## Early Life and Career Beginnings

Perminova grew up in Berdsk and initially pursued a traditional educational path, studying at the Kuzbass Institute of Economics and Law. However, she eventually dropped out to pursue a modeling career[2][3]. At 17, she faced a serious legal challenge involving a drug-related incident, which could have resulted in imprisonment. Her father wrote to Alexander Lebedev, a state deputy, who helped her avoid jail time by arranging her cooperation with investigators[2].

After overcoming her legal troubles, Perminova launched a successful modeling career. She appeared in Playboy and became the magazine's "Girl of the Month"[2][3]. She walked runways for prestigious fashion brands like Armani, Viktor & Rolf, and Lanvin, showcasing collections in Paris, Milan, and Rome[2].

In a personal update at the end of 2024, Perminova announced her separation from Lebedev, stating "Even the most beautiful stories come to an end"[3].
