Kolhui (Rus. Колхуи, колдовские художники) is an art collective based in St. Petersburg, Russia, known for its unique and eclectic approach to contemporary art. The group, often referred to as the "Sorcery Artists," emphasizes originality and creativity among its members, each of whom develops distinct styles and genres. For instance, Nikolai Kopeikin is noted for his fervent cartoon realism, while Andrei Kagadeev focuses on creating evil characters and morbid imagery[2][3].

## Key Features of Kolhui

- **Artistic Philosophy**: Kolhui promotes a radical aesthetic that values quality in contemporary art, aiming to cultivate an educated and aesthetically aware audience[3].
- **Exhibitions**: The group has been involved in various exhibitions, such as "LIBIDO" and "Ablakaty Balalaikina," showcasing a range of artistic expressions from narrative and ironic art to art-brut and naive art[6][2].
- **Gallery Space**: The Pig's Snout Art Gallery serves as the main venue for Kolhui's activities. It operates as an artist-run space that features contemporary works and is open to the public several days a week[5][8].

Kolhui continues to be a significant player in the St. Petersburg art scene, blending humor, irony, and critical commentary through their diverse artistic practices.
