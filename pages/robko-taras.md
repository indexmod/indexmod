Taras Rabko is a 36-year-old lawyer who married supermodel Irina Vodolazova in 2013. He was a close friend of Boris Yeltsin's grandson and became known for his connections to the National Bolshevik Party in the 1990s[3].

## Background
Rabko was part of the social circle around Eduard Limonov and was considered a serious, wealthy professional. He married Irina Vodolazova after she previously had a relationship with Boris Yeltsin's grandson. Despite potentially taking his friend's romantic interest, Boris Yeltsin was reportedly not upset and even sent a video congratulation to the newlyweds[3].

## Marriage Details
Their wedding took place in Barviha and was attended by notable personalities like Alexander Oleshko, Olga Shelest, Alexander Serov, and the group "Ivanushki International". Boris Yeltsin was not physically present but sent his congratulations via video[3].

Interestingly, Irina's mother, Valentina Leonidovna, had previously expressed preference for Rabko over her daughter's previous relationship, noting his serious nature and professional success[3].
