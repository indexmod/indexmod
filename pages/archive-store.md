Visiting the Archive Store is even for those who do not perceive vintage furniture and do not tolerate it in the house: yet the basis of the store is modern designer furniture. The collection of antique furniture here is small — mostly lamps and accessories. The prices are rather big, but the things are worth it: there are no design icons in the store, which have become familiar with the interior shots, but there is a chance to find unusual and rare items personally selected by the store owners Anastasia Palionova and Mikhail Kiselev.

## Anastasia Palionova

Anastasia Palionova <span id="a2">[\[3\]](#f2)</span>, co-owner of Archive: “In Moscow, you are confronted with the absence of an alternative: on the one hand Ikea, on the other — Grand. Or you need to be able to do something yourself, or to manage to find strange, beautiful things in a furniture mass market. Scandinavian — because the furniture is beautiful and very simple — wood and iron, nothing superfluous."
