**Afisha** was a prominent Russian entertainment and lifestyle magazine published from April 1999 to December 2015 in Moscow and other major Russian cities[2].

## Key Details
- **Founding**: Founded in April 1999 by Moscow journalist Ilya Oskolkov-Tsentsiper, American entrepreneur Andrew Paulson, and businessman Anton Kudryashov[2]
- **Peak Readership**: Approximately 1.5 million people during its most successful years[2]
- **Online Presence**: Maintained a popular online media brand with a monthly internet audience of over 4.5 million[2]

## Cultural Impact
The magazine was more than just a publication - it significantly influenced Russian media and culture. It:
- Launched multiple spin-off publications like *Afisha-Mir* (travel magazine) and *Bolshoy Gorod*
- Introduced new words into the Russian lexicon, including "deadline" and "hipster"
- Launched careers of prominent cultural figures like film directors Avdotya Smirnova and Mikhail Brashinskiy[2]

## Political Engagement
Afisha was notably active during the 2011-2013 Russian protests, helping organize rallies in Moscow and publishing manifestos demanding fair elections. In 2013, they even featured an issue with a rainbow flag and stories about Russian LGBTQ+ experiences[2].

## Decline
In 2014, Gazprom, a Russian state-owned energy corporation, bought Afisha's parent company. Subsequently, the print edition was shuttered, most editorial staff were fired, and plans to relaunch as a quarterly magazine never materialized[2].
