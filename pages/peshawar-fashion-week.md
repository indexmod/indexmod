Peshawar Fashion Week (PFW) is an annual fashion event held in Peshawar, Pakistan, representing the culture of the region, particularly Khyber Pakhtunkhwa[4]. However, the event has faced challenges in its continuity. The fashion week has been postponed indefinitely due to political concerns and security reasons[6].

## Event Details

- Organized by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Fashion Design and Arts Council (KPFDAC)[8]
- Has featured various local designers presenting their collections

## Notable Instances
Several fashion shows have been held in Peshawar over the years, including:
- A fashion show on February 11, 2013 in a local hotel[2]
- A Pak-Afghan fashion show on October 25, 2018, featuring designers like Omaid Rasul and Mansoor Rajpoot[2]
- A fashion show on December 1, 2016, with designers like Nazish, Zahid, and Beenish Khan[2]

The event's primary goal is to promote local fashion and support regional designers, particularly highlighting the products of women designers[8].
