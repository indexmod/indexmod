Fyodor Borisovich Pavlov-Andreevich is a Russian-Brazilian performance artist, curator, and theater director born on April 14, 1976, in Moscow, Russia[2]. He comes from a notable artistic family, being the son of film historian Boris Pavlov and writer Lyudmila Petrushevskaya, and is descended from a linguist and a Ukrainian Jewish revolutionary[2].

## Early Career and Background

Pavlov-Andreevich began his career in the 1990s as a journalist and television presenter before transitioning into the contemporary culture sector[2]. He graduated with an MA in European literature from Moscow State University's journalism department in 1999[2].

## Artistic Practice

His artistic work primarily focuses on three key subjects:
- The relationship between spectators and performance art
- The temporality and vulnerability of the human body
- The connection between the sacred and the obscene[2]

### Performance Art

Pavlov-Andreevich gained international recognition for his provocative performances, most notably the **"Foundling"** series, which involved guerrilla interventions at high-profile events like the Met Gala, where he was once arrested for trespassing and public nudity[2]. His **Temporary Monuments** series (2014-2017) explored contemporary slavery in Brazil and Russia through intense performative experiences[2].

### Recent Work

In 2023, he created **ANTIFURNITURE** at the Design Museum in London, an interactive exhibition of sculptures that challenge perceptions of comfort and fear. Visitors are invited to engage with wooden displays, transforming them into personal performance pieces[4].

## Activism and Political Stance

Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Pavlov-Andreevich has been vocal in his opposition to Putin's aggression, incorporating his political activism into his artistic work[2].

## Recognition

His work has been praised by notable figures like Marina AbramoviÄ‡, who described his art as "capable of surprising us with ever new ways of seeing the world we live in"[2]. British art historian Adrian Heathfield characterized his practice as powerful performance art dealing with body, power, and participation[2].

His works are held in collections including the Museu de Arte do Rio, Moscow Museum of Modern Art, and the Design Museum in London[2].
