Coty, the global beauty company, announced its decision to exit the Russian market in April 2022[2][3]. The company began winding down its operations in Russia immediately following the announcement[4]. This decision came in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022[3].

Prior to the exit, Russia accounted for approximately 3% of Coty's sales and contributed a mid-single digit percentage to its adjusted EBITDA[2][4]. Despite this, Coty did not expect the decision to impact its fiscal 2022 revenue and profit targets[3].

As of January 2025, Coty has completed its exit from Russia. The company's financial results for fiscal year 2024 (FY24) showed strong performance globally, with total net revenues growing 10% on a reported basis and 11% on a like-for-like (LFL) basis[5]. This growth outpaced the global beauty market, which grew approximately 9%[5].

## Impact and Aftermath

The exit from Russia had some negative impact on Coty's performance:

- In the first half of 2023, Coty's sales declined 1% as reported, while LFL sales grew 6%, including approximately 300 basis points of negative impact from the Russia exit[1].
- The company had to lay off its entire staff in Russia as part of the exit process[7].

Despite these challenges, Coty has continued to perform well in other markets. The company has seen strong growth in its e-commerce channel, with reported net revenues growing by over 20% in FY24[5]. Coty has also maintained momentum in growth engine markets and high-growth channels, particularly in Travel Retail and markets such as Brazil, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa[5].
