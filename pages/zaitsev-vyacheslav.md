Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Zaitsev was a renowned Russian fashion designer, painter, graphic artist, and theatrical costume designer who became a legendary figure in Soviet and Russian fashion[1][2].

**Early Life and Background**
Born on March 2, 1938, in Ivanovo (a textile capital of Russia), Zaitsev came from humble beginnings. His childhood was challenging, with his mother working as a washer and cleaner, and his father initially labeled as an "enemy of the people". He was born with the surname Kokurin and later took his father's surname after his rehabilitation[2].

**Career Highlights**
Zaitsev rose to prominence in the 1960s, becoming one of the most prominent fashion designers of the Soviet Union. He was often compared to international fashion icons like Christian Dior and Yves Saint Laurent, earning the nickname "Red Dior" in Western press[1][2]. Some of his notable achievements include:

- Became the artistic director of an experimental garment factory in 1962
- Chief designer at the All-Union Fashion House in 1965
- Designed costumes for the Soviet Olympic team in 1980
- Created collections that incorporated traditional Russian and Slavic styles
- Founded his own fashion house "Slava Zaitsev" which operated for 40 years[2]

**International Recognition**
Despite limitations under the communist regime, Zaitsev gained international attention. Paris Match was the first foreign media to profile him in 1963, and he eventually presented collections in countries like Japan, the USA, Italy, and Canada[2].

**Later Life and Legacy**
In 2016, Zaitsev was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, which led to his retirement. His last fashion show was held in 2018, and his son Egor now manages the fashion house. Zaitsev passed away on April 30, 2023, at the age of 85 in Shchyolkovo, leaving behind a significant legacy in Russian fashion design[1][2].
