(Rus. Лампа из минидисков) created in 2015, Moscow is a light-kinetic installation by DJ Freak in a genre of glowing art and mixed media.

Minidisc one of the most convenient music storage format, like floppy 3'5 inches, but in a thicker and more compact than the floppy plastic body has a hard disk, which in real time can be easily and repeatedly record music or audio information or analog digitally. It was a digital analog audio cassettes, with a higher sound quality (relevant mp3 128 kbps). In place of minidisc players and flash drives come with flash memory, however, it remains a pleasant design MiniDisc subject that simply can not be thrown in the trash.1 Login to edit
