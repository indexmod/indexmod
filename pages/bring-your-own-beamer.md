BYOB (Bring Your Own Beamer) is a series of one-night exhibitions where artists showcase their work through projections[1][4]. Conceived by net-art visionary Rafaël Rozendaal, these events are immersive, spontaneous, and always surprising[1][5].

The concept is simple:
1. Find a venue
2. Invite multiple artists
3. Ask them to bring their own projectors (beamers)[4]

BYOB events are free, inclusive, and require minimal budget[3][4]. They explore the medium of projection and serve as a playground for artists working with video art, generative art, and various forms of digital creativity[1][4].

These exhibitions have become popular worldwide, with approximately 350 BYOB events held in cities across the globe[4]. They often take place in diverse settings, from museum lawns to community spaces, attracting both participants and picnicking audiences[2].

BYOB events are open to various forms of projection, including video, film, overhead projectors, and slides[2]. They offer a democratic platform for artists to share their work and for audiences to experience a unique, collaborative artistic environment[1][3].

## Acronym of BYOB

## Mission

BYOB is for anyone who is interested in moving light, sound and performance. Projection can mean many things. Projections are flexible and create a freedom to react to each others works, move things around, and create a dynamic collaborative experience. Hopefully there will be many different kinds of BYOB’s.
