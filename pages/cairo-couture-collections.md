Cairo Couture Collections is a luxury fashion event held in Egypt, showcasing high-end designers and their creations[2][7]. The event has been running for multiple seasons, with the fourth season featuring a collection of contact lenses as part of its offerings[4].

One notable designer who has participated in the Cairo Couture Collections is Rana Madkour, who presented her designs under the brand @ranamadkourdesigns[2]. The event aims to provide a platform for both local and international designers to showcase their haute couture creations in the Egyptian capital.

In addition to traditional runway shows, Cairo Couture Collections has expanded to include unique venues and experiences. Recently, as part of Cairo Design Week, a haute couture collection was unveiled at the majestic Citadel of Salah al-Din, blending historical architecture with contemporary fashion[5].

While not directly related to Cairo Couture Collections, it's worth noting that Egypt has become a sought-after location for international fashion houses as well. In 2022, Dior held a significant menswear show near the Pyramids of Giza, further cementing Egypt's place on the global fashion map[1][6].

These events collectively contribute to Egypt's growing reputation as a fashion destination, combining its rich cultural heritage with modern couture to create unique and memorable fashion experiences.
