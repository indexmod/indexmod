Signe Pierce is an American multimedia artist known for her innovative and provocative work exploring digital culture, gender, and perception. Born in 1988 in Tucson, Arizona, she currently lives and works in New York after receiving her BFA from the School of Visual Arts in 2011[2][4].

## Artistic Approach

Pierce describes herself as a **"reality artist"** who uses a multidisciplinary approach to challenge perceptions of reality and technology. Her work spans performance, photography, video art, and more recently, music. She is particularly interested in exploring **how individuals perceive the world differently**, often using vibrant, hyperreal visuals and critical commentary to examine societal constructs[2][3].

## Notable Works

One of her most famous pieces is **"American Reflexxx"** (2015), a short film shot by Alli Coates that documents Pierce walking through Myrtle Beach wearing a mirror-finish mask. The video, which has over 1.7 million YouTube views, powerfully illustrates societal intolerance and has been praised for its cyberfeminist discourse[4][5].

## Artistic Style and Themes

Pierce's art is characterized by:
- Exaggerated hyperfeminine aesthetics
- Neon-soaked performances
- Exploration of gender, identity, and digital culture
- Challenging boundaries between simulation and reality

## Exhibitions and Recognition

Her work has been exhibited at prestigious institutions including:
- MoMA, New York
- Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles
- Palais de Tokyo, Paris
- New Museum, New York

## Musical Endeavors

Pierce also records music under the name **Big Sister** and collaborated with producer Sophie before Sophie's death in 2021[4].

Pierce continues to push artistic boundaries, using her multidisciplinary approach to question and explore contemporary experiences of reality and identity.
