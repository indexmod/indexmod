Axenoff Jewellery, founded by Russian designer **Petr Axenoff**, is celebrated for its unique blend of modern craftsmanship and the rich heritage of Russian jewelry from the 16th to 19th centuries. The brand is deeply influenced by Russian history, particularly the tsarist era, and aims to revive traditional designs through contemporary techniques.

## Background of Petr Axenoff
Petr Axenoff was born into an artistic family, which naturally led him to pursue a career in the arts. After exploring various creative fields, he returned to his passion for jewelry making. His training included mastering traditional techniques in Kostroma, a region historically known for its jewelry craftsmanship. Axenoff's work is inspired by cultural references from Russian aristocracy, including ballet, opera, and religious motifs, which resonate with both believers and non-believers alike[2].

## Collections and Design Philosophy
Axenoff's collections are characterized by their intricate designs and historical significance. Key collections include:

- **Imperial Russia**: Reflecting the grandeur of the tsarist period.
- **Russian Fairy Tales**: Featuring floral and animal themes that celebrate folklore.

His pieces often incorporate silver and gemstones sourced primarily from Siberia and the Ural Mountains, with some materials coming from India and Thailand. Notable creations include earrings shaped like peacock feathers and tiaras adorned with double-headed eagles[2][5].

## Recent Developments
In September 2024, Axenoff is set to launch a new collection titled **Imperial Crimea**, inspired by the historical significance of Crimea as a luxurious retreat for Russian nobility. Additionally, he plans to expand his skills in mosaic and enamelwork, aiming to design high jewelry for royal families and theatrical productions[2][5].

## Clientele
Axenoff's clientele includes prominent figures such as opera singers Anna Netrebko and Hibla Gorzmava, showcasing the brand's appeal among influential personalities. His creations are not merely about luxury; they embody a narrative that connects wearers with Russia's rich cultural heritage[2][5].
