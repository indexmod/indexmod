Born in Hampshire in 1973 and based in London, Sophie has a distinctive abstract visual style which captures the spirit of a place. She works with in oils and acrylic with an intensely vivid palette and inventive mark-making. It is important to Sophie that she feels a strong connection to a place when painting it.

Later this year, she is invited to be artist in residence in Goa, India to immerse herself in different landscapes and create a new body of work to show in 2019. Sophie has a background in Anthropology, Art and teaching. After spending many years working as a Governess in Europe and Moscow, she decided to concentrate fully on developing her artistic abilities. She studied at Fine Art Morley College and works from her studio in Clapham. She is currently a student of the Turps Art School correspondence programme. Her work is in private collections in the UK and abroad. She is currently showing at this year’s 250th Royal Academy Summer Exhibition.
