Goyol is an annual fashion event held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, that has been running since 1988[2]. The event, organized by the Mongolian Designers Association, showcases the best of Mongolian fashion and selects top models, designers, hairdressers, and makeup artists[1].

The most recent Goyol Fashion Festival, titled "Goyol 2024," took place from November 19, 2023, at the Shanglri-La Mall in Ulaanbaatar[1]. This seven-day event marked the 36th iteration of the festival[1]. The gala performance, which is a highlight of the event, was broadcast live on the TV8 channel[1].

Looking ahead, preparations for the Goyol 2025 Fashion Show are already underway[6]. This upcoming event will mark the 37th year of the festival's history[3]. While specific details about Goyol 2025 have not been officially announced, promotional content has started appearing on social media platforms, indicating that the event is "Coming Soon"[6].

Goyol plays a significant role in shaping Mongolia's fashion trends and overall aesthetic[3]. It serves as a platform for showcasing local talent and promoting the country's fashion industry on both national and international stages.
