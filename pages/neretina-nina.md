Nina Neretina is a Russian fashion designer and artist born in 1967 near Voronezh, Russia[1][6]. She is best known as one half of the design duo Nina Donis, which she co-founded with Donis Poupis in 2000[1][2].

## Early Career and Education

Neretina met her design partner Donis Poupis while studying at the Moscow Textile Academy from 1987 to 1992[1][8]. During this period, they began collaborating artistically, and their partnership would eventually lead to the establishment of their avant-garde fashion brand[1].

## Nina Donis Brand

In 2000, Neretina and Poupis officially launched the Nina Donis brand, creating ready-to-wear collections that are known for their unique aesthetic[1][2]. Their designs are characterized by:

- Conceptual mini collections
- Influences from Russian avant-garde, constructivism, and Soviet culture
- Inspiration from diverse sources like Pushkin's tales, Russian cinema, and Soviet rock[2]
- Bold and eclectic design approach that reflects the political and cultural transitions of post-Soviet Russia[1]
