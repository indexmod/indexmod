## Bio of Lorenzo Albrighi

Lorenzo was born in London on November 1987 by an Italian/American father and an English mother, growing up between Florence and Milan, grew a deep passion for the Italian fashion scene, which brought him to start sewing as an apprentice tailor at 20 years old in the historical sartoria A. Caraceni in Milan, serving clients from Karl Lagerfeld, Gianfranco Ferrè, Calvin Klein and many other high profile individuals.
After two years of learning the basics of traditional Italian bespoke tailoring he moved to Florence to learn the basics of cutting suits from Neapolitan cutter and master Mario Sciales at Sartoria M. Marinaro, serving the Florentine aristocracy as the Pucci family and other historical families.

After two years of cutting and sewing suits he set up his own tailoring house, featured in the Louis Vuitton Milan City Guide as one of the best ateliers in town, with clients ranging from members of the Arab Royal family, fashion photographer Giovanni Gastel, to the Co-Founder of Net-A-Porter, Arnaud Massenet, who then became the first investor in Lablaco.

Having worked for almost ten years in the fashion industry and launching his ready to wear line, he met ShihYun Kuo, working at Giorgio Armani as Buying and Merchandising Manager for Asia Pacific and realized the current fashion system is broken as it is now one of the largest polluting industries in the world.
So they Founded Lablaco in 2016,  the first Circular Fashion platform with mission to tackle fashion’s biggest challenge of redesigning a new digital and circular fashion system for a transparent and sustainable future for brands and consumers worldwide.
