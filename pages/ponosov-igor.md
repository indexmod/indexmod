Igor Ponosov is a Moscow-based artist, curator, and researcher specializing in urban art and activism. Born on December 14, 1980, in Nizhnevartovsk, Russia, he has established himself as a prominent figure in contemporary urban art[2][5][7].

**Professional Background**

- Artist, independent curator, and researcher focused on urban environments[2][3]
- Author of multiple books on urban art, including "Art and the City" and "Russian Urban Art: History and Conflicts"[2]

**Artistic Practice**
Ponosov's artistic work is characterized by a critical and poetic approach to urban spaces. In his studio, he creates drawings and collages using materials found on the street, such as advertising banners and building elements. His street works aim to comprehend and engage with the specific context of their location[3].

**Notable Achievements**
- Laureate of The Sergey Kuryokhin Contemporary Art Award in 2016[2]
- Nominated for the Kandinsky Prize in 2019[2]
- Conducted art residencies in New York and Moscow[2]

**Publications and Projects**
Between 2005 and 2009, Ponosov published three books on street art in Russia and the ex-USSR. In 2011, he founded the Partizaning art project as a platform for exchange among activists, artists, and urbanists. His books have been launched in multiple European cities, including Paris, Berlin, and Helsinki[2].

**Interdisciplinary Interests**
Beyond urban art, Ponosov is interested in contemporary art, activism, performances, and conceptual practices[8].
