MishMash is an art group consisting of two artists, Misha Leykin and Masha Sumnina[2]. They are known for their unique artistic approach that explores the boundaries between chaos and order.

## Artistic Philosophy
The artists describe their work as a blend of unpredictable elements, stating: "We bring uncontrollable forces into our works - wind, mold, water, spectator, coincidence, found art, etc., exploring the relationship between chaos and order"[2]. Their art is characterized by:

- A close study of art boundaries inherited from Moscow romantic conceptualism
- A "peculiar lyricism and humanity" fueled by trust in random elements
- A focus on concept over recognizable visual style

## Background
- Misha Leykin graduated from the Moscow Institute of Architecture in 1994
- Was a member of the Obledenenie Arkhitektorov group from 1997 to 2001
- Masha Sumnina graduated from the Institute of Printwork in 2001[2]

## Notable Recognition
The art group was featured as **Artist of the Year** at Cosmoscow in 2019, where they presented a "total microspective" of their work[2]. Their artistic approach embraces what they call "hideoism" - a philosophy that finds beauty in the unexpected and perceives art as overcoming obstacles.
