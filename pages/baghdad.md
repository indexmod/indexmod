Baghdad's fashion and art scene has experienced a remarkable revival in recent years, marking a significant shift from its tumultuous past. The city has witnessed a resurgence of cultural events and artistic expressions, breathing new life into its creative landscape.

## Fashion Scene

In 2015, Baghdad hosted its first fashion show since 1988, showcasing the work of six home-grown designers<strong>[1]</strong>. This event marked a turning point for the city's fashion industry, which had been dormant for decades due to political instability and security concerns. The show featured 16 young Iraqi women modeling collections that blended traditional Arab themes with modern urban designs, captivating an audience of around 500 people<strong>[1]</strong>.

## Art Scene

Baghdad's art scene has flourished in recent years, with several new galleries opening and existing ones expanding their reach:

- **Hewar Art Gallery**: One of Baghdad's longest-running modern and contemporary galleries, opened in 1992<strong>[3]</strong>.
- **The Gallery**: A new art space that opened in October 2022, focusing on supporting Iraqi artists and showcasing a different side of the country<strong>[3]</strong>.
- **Akkad Gallery**: Reopened in a new location in Karradeh in March 2022<strong>[4]</strong>.
- **Baghdada Gallery**: Opened by private collectors, featuring 20th and 21st century Iraqi art<strong>[4]</strong>.
- **Anaween Gallery**: Opened by a local filmmaker in 2021 in Adhimiya<strong>[4]</strong>.

The art scene has been bolstered by a combination of state support and private sponsorship, leading to what some describe as an art "explosion"<strong>[4]</strong>. This revival has been accompanied by the restoration of cultural landmarks, such as the al-Rashid theatre, and the commissioning of new murals throughout the city<strong>[4]</strong>.

## Cultural Renaissance

The resurgence of Baghdad's fashion and art scene is part of a broader cultural renaissance:

1. Increased security has allowed galleries to stay open in the evenings<strong>[4]</strong>.
2. The reopening of the Iraqi Museum in March 2022 has further enriched the city's cultural offerings<strong>[4]</strong>.
3. Cultural tourism is on the rise, thanks to new visa-on-demand policies<strong>[4]</strong>.
4. The art market has seen growth, with new collectors emerging from the "nouveau riche" class<strong>[4]</strong>.

This cultural revival not only provides hope and artistic expression for the Iraqi people but also offers a window into the aspirations and concerns of Iraqi youth<strong>[3]</strong>. As the city continues to heal from its past, the flourishing fashion and art scene stands as a testament to Baghdad's resilience and creativity.
