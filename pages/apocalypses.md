### My first job (1992)

Anton Chudia, 1992, “My first work”, ballpoint pen, paper, 19.5x60 cm. / アントン・チュディア、1992年、「私の最初の仕事」、ボールペン、紙、19.5x60 cm。
Anton Chudinov, also known as Chudya, was born in 1979 on Vasilyevsky Island in St. Petersburg, Russia. He graduated from art school and worked as a stylist and makeup artist in Moscow in the 2000s. He was friends with contemporary artists and the metropolitan elite, including Oleg Ognenny, Vlad Monroe, and Arthur Lomakin.

The online collection presented here is the first and only collection created by Chudinov at the age of 12. It includes more than 20 works, all made in the form of panoramas on paper with a ballpoint pen. The works depict apocalyptic battles with crusaders, karatekas, spiders, dragons, giant octopuses, and robots.

Chudinov's work is remarkable for its dynamism, energy, and imagination. He captures the chaos and excitement of battle with a bold and expressive style. His use of ballpoint pen is particularly effective, as it allows him to create quick, fluid lines that convey a sense of movement and urgency.

The collection offers a unique glimpse into the mind of a young artist with a wild imagination. Chudinov's work is both playful and disturbing, and it challenges viewers to see the world in a new way.

## Highlights from the Collection:

+ My First Job (1992)
+ Robbery (1992)
+ Destroying Huge Spiders (1992)
+ Apocalypse (1992)

Chudinov's collection is a must-see for fans of contemporary art, outsider art, and anything just plain weird. It is a testament to the power of imagination and the importance of expressing oneself creatively.

Anton Chudinov's collection of teenage art is a unique exploration of the naive. His works, all created at the age of 12, are characterized by their bold and expressive style, their imaginative subject matter, and their lack of formal training.

Chudinov's work is often compared to that of naive artists, who are typically self-taught and create art that is free from the constraints of academic tradition. Like naive art, Chudinov's work is often characterized by its use of bright colors, simple forms, and a sense of childlike wonder.

However, Chudinov's work also has its own unique qualities. His subjects are often darker and more disturbing than those typically found in naive art. He depicts apocalyptic battles, scenes of violence, and other disturbing imagery. This suggests that Chudinov was not simply interested in creating art that was playful and innocent. He was also exploring his own inner world, which was clearly complex and troubled.

In the words of Alexey Turchin, a transhumanist, collector of naive art, and author of the book "Futurology": "Teenage art is a not fully studied phenomenon, lying between children’s drawings, naive art and art brut. Teenage art is temporally bound as children's art, but it is much more complex and diverse, and sometimes reaches genuine depth. Like Art Brut, it is like creativity in an altered state of consciousness. Just like naive art, it is often self-generated."

Chudinov's teenage art is a perfect example of what Turchin describes. It is complex, diverse, and deeply expressive. It is also a testament to the power of imagination and the importance of artistic expression, even at a young age.

Chudinov's collection is a valuable addition to the world of naive art. It offers a unique glimpse into the mind of a young artist with a wild imagination. His work is both playful and disturbing, and it challenges viewers to see the world in a new way.
