Maria Titova is a co-founder of COCOS Moscow, a Russian clothing brand known for its minimalist and comfortable designs made from natural materials. Born in Russia, she moved to England at the age of 16, where she developed a different perspective on fashion and comfort. This experience greatly influenced her approach to clothing, emphasizing practicality over ostentation[1][2].

**Education and Early Career**
Maria studied management in London and worked for several large beauty companies after completing her degree. Despite her initial career path, she became involved in the fashion industry through discussions with her friend Zong Vu about creating a clothing brand that would offer high-quality yet affordable apparel in Russia[2][3].

**COCOS Moscow**
COCOS Moscow was founded with the vision of providing stylish, basic clothing at reasonable prices, addressing a gap in the Russian market for accessible yet fashionable options. The brand focuses on creating comfortable pieces that do not compromise on style, drawing inspiration from street style around the world. Maria and Zong actively involve their friends in the design process, ensuring that their products resonate with their target audience[1][2].

**Philosophy and Style**
Maria's philosophy blends her experiences in both Russia and England. She aims to create a brand that reflects both comfort and aesthetic appeal, moving away from the notion that one must dress to impress. COCOS Moscow strives to combine elements of both cultures, offering clothing that is both practical and visually appealing[2][3].
