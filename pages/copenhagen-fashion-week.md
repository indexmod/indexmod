Copenhagen Fashion Week (CPHFW) is an international biannual fashion event held in Copenhagen, Denmark. First established in 2006, it emerged from the merger of Danish clothing trade fairs dating back to the 1950s[2].

## Event Details
The event takes place twice a year, with the upcoming Autumn/Winter 2025 edition scheduled from January 27-31, 2025[1][4]. It spans five days and features:
- Fashion shows
- Presentations
- Trade shows (CIFF and Revolver)
- Open showrooms
- Talks
- Parties

## Organizational Structure
Copenhagen Fashion Week is a non-profit organization with a unique funding model:
- 15% public funding
- 85% commercial partnerships
- Main contributor is the Danish Ministry of Industry, Business and Financial Affairs[2]

## Sustainability Focus
A key distinguishing feature of CPHFW is its strong commitment to sustainability. In 2018, CEO Cecilie Thorsmark established an advisory board to organize sustainability practices. The event now requires participating brands to:
- Demonstrate that at least 50% of their collection uses certified, preferred, up-cycled, or recycled materials
- Commit to due diligence throughout their supply chain[2][3]

The event has gained international recognition for showcasing Scandinavian fashion brands and setting new standards for sustainable fashion practices[3].
