Yana Raskovalova is a prominent Russian jeweller and designer, known for her eponymous brand, Yana Jewellery. Born on March 5, 1976, in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), she grew up in a well-off family and developed an early interest in art and design, eventually studying at the St. Petersburg Institute of Service and Economics[2][5].

### Career Path
Initially, Raskovalova pursued a modeling career, gaining recognition as "Vice-Miss St. Petersburg" in 1997. However, her passion for jewellery led her to create her first pieces, which she made for herself and friends. This hobby quickly evolved into a professional venture when she realized there was demand for her unique designs[2][4]. In 2011, she launched her first collection at the Podium Concept Store, featuring intricate pieces made from gold, diamonds, ivory, and cameosâ€”elements that have become hallmarks of her brand[1][2].

Raskovalova's designs are characterized by their exquisite craftsmanship and the use of traditional Russian techniques. Each piece is often a one-off creation, taking up to six months from concept to completion[1]. Her collections include not only jewellery but also clothing and perfume lines, showcasing her versatility as a designer. In 2017, she expanded into fashion with her first clothing collection and has since continued to grow her brand's presence internationally[4][7].

### Personal Life
Yana Raskovalova is married to businessman Vadim Raskovalov, and they have four children together. The couple's wedding took place in the historic Catherine Palace in Tsarskoye Selo in 2002[2][5]. Raskovalova is also known for her social connections within the fashion industry, often collaborating with other notable figures such as Ksenia Sobchak and Ulyana Sergeenko to promote her brand[2][5].

### Recent Developments
As of late 2023, Raskovalova continues to innovate within her brand. She recently launched a new clothing line called "Diva," inspired by Hollywood's glamorous 1940s aesthetics. This collection was showcased at a lavish event that included a dinner and poker game[2]. Her brand remains popular among celebrities and high-profile clients, further solidifying its status in the luxury market[1][4].

In summary, Yana Raskovalova has established herself as a significant figure in the jewellery design world through her unique creations that blend antique elegance with modern sensibilities. Her ongoing expansion into fashion and fragrance reflects her dynamic approach to design and entrepreneurship.
