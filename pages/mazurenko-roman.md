Roman Mazurenko was a young Belarusian tech entrepreneur and cultural figure who tragically died on November 28, 2015, in Moscow after being struck by a car[2]. Born in Belarus in 1981, he was the only child of Sergei, an engineer, and Victoria, a landscape architect[3].

## Professional Background
Mazurenko was the CEO and Founder of Stampsy.com[6], a technology startup. He was based in New York and had 456 professional connections on LinkedIn[5]. Despite not being very interested in social media, he was considered a legendary figure in Moscow's cultural and artistic circles[2].

## Digital Legacy
After his untimely death, his friend Eugenia Kuyda created a unique digital memorial. Using thousands of text messages exchanged with Roman since 2008, she developed an AI chatbot that could mimic his communication style. This bot was inspired by a "Black Mirror" episode and allowed friends and family to "communicate" with Roman's digital ghost[2].

Mazurenko was known for his distinctive communication style, which included mild dyslexia and the use of idiosyncratic phrases. His digital memorial became a poignant example of how technology can preserve memories and connections after death[2].
