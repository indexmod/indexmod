RusModa is a fashion company based in Moscow, primarily known for its association with the designer Alexander Terekhov. The brand has experienced various phases since its inception, including significant growth and challenges.

## **Company Overview**
- **Founding and Growth**: RusModa was established during a collaboration between Oksana Lavrentieva and Alena Akhmadullina, with Lavrentieva taking over the company after a fallout with Akhmadullina. The brand initially focused on promoting Terekhov's collections and quickly gained traction, achieving substantial sales figures shortly after its launch[2].
- **Sales Performance**: By 2011, RusModa's revenue reached 143 million rubles, although it faced losses of 77.4 million rubles that year. Despite these challenges, the brand expanded its offerings and opened boutiques, increasing revenue significantly in subsequent years[2].

## **Challenges**
- **Market Competition**: The brand has faced intense competition from other fashion labels, which has impacted its market position. As consumer preferences shifted, RusModa struggled to maintain its customer base amidst rising competition from both premium and budget brands[2].
- **Impact of the Pandemic**: The COVID-19 pandemic severely affected RusModa's operations, leading to store closures and significant layoffs. The company had to adapt quickly to changing market conditions, including selling off assets and reducing staff to cope with declining sales[2].
